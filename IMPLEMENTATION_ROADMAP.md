## Technical Implementation Strategy

### State Management Migration
- **Current**: Context API
- **Recommended**: Migrate to Zustand for better performance
- **Timeline**: Phase 1
- **Benefits**: Better persistence, performance, and scalability

### Data Structure Enhancements
```typescript
// Enhanced game state structure
interface EnhancedGameState {
  player: Player & {
    achievements: string[];
    researchPoints: number;
  };
  inventory: ItemWithQuality[];
  recipes: EnhancedRecipe[];
  materials: MaterialWithProperties[];
  enchantments: Enchantment[];
  market: MarketState;
  events: WorldEvent[];
  apprentices: Apprentice[];
  customers: CustomerWithRelationship[];
  research: ResearchTree;
  shop: ShopCustomization;
  calendar: GameCalendar;
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **State Management Complexity**: Migrate to Zustand early (Phase 1)
2. **Performance Issues**: Implement virtualization for large lists
3. **Save/Load Corruption**: Robust validation and migration system

### Scope Risks
1. **Feature Creep**: Stick to defined phases strictly
2. **Timeline Pressure**: Focus on core mechanics first
3. **Quality Compromise**: Maintain testing throughout development

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 1 implementation with quality system
2. Set up Zustand store architecture
3. Implement achievement system as foundation
4. Create export/import functionality for testing
